# Learning FastAPI

This repository documents my journey of learning **FastAPI** by building a **RESTful API** project. The goal is to gain hands-on experience with FastAPI's features and build a practical API with:

- CRUD operations
- Database integration
- Authentication
- Cloud integration
- API testing with pytest

## Project Structure

- `app/` - The FastAPI application.
- `models/` - Database models and schemas.
- `tests/` - Unit tests and API tests.
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies.
- `README.md` - Project documentation.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dsrathore1/Learning-FastAPI.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    git checkout Project-{version}
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the FastAPI application:

    ```bash
    fastapi dev app/main.py
    ```

2. Visit the API docs at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` to interact with the API.
