<h1 align="center">Learning FastAPI 🚀</h1>

This repository documents my journey of acquiring proficiency in **FastAPI** through the development of a **RESTful API** project. The primary objective is to gain hands-on experience with the key features of FastAPI while building a practical and scalable API that includes the following capabilities:

## Features ✨
- **Fully functional RESTful API** with CRUD operations
- **JWT-based authentication** for secure access
- **Database models** with **SQL & NON SQL** integration
- **Cloud deployment support** (AWS, Azure and GCP)
- **Test-driven development** using pytest
- **OpenAPI & Swagger Docs** for easy interaction
